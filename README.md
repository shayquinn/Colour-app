"# Colour-app" 
This app was developed to add colour to a carousel, to illustrate depth of field, and can be configured to give a lighting effect. See the image. Credit where credit is due I use this jsfiddle as a starting point “http://jsfiddle.net/maniator/tKrM9/53/”

To open the app highlight the index file and right click, open with whatever browser. This has not been tested with all browsers, Firefox and chrome should work fine. Number is the number of segments, point is where it should start, and curve is how tight the curve should be. It has tolerances and will brake on some higher numbers
